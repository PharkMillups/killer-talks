# Killer Talks 

One of the distinct joys and privileges I've had as Community Manager at [Basho](http://basho.com) is being able to attend, view, and facilitate technical talks. Technical talks are a form of intellectual currency; talented speakers are heralded and sought after (for good reason), and fanboys like me memorize URLs of favorites so they can get credit for introducing a classic to a newcomer. ("Bro, you haven't seen Hickey's _Simple Made Easy?_")

When you see a talk you love, it sticks with you. Why was it so memorable? A few potential reasons:

* The ideas and assertions were actually novel and new, and presented with passion (even if you disagreed with them)
* Someone was able to take esoteric concepts and turn them into something comprehensible and concrete
* The speaker was a pure entertainer, and had a perfect mix of technical depth, wit, wisdom, and passion
* The slide quality and talk preparation were second-to-none
* The speaker didn't use slides, and it blew your mind
* The production quality (filming, editing, etc.) was exceptional and should be emulated
 
As usual, **pull requests are encouraged**. I'll be updating this regularly but there are scores of killer talks out there, and I've only seen a trivial portion of them. *If you're contributing a talk, include a few words on why you're adding it and some sort of self-attribution so that people can know from whom it came.*

### Talks (in no particular order)

* [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) (**Rich Hickey, Strange Loop 2011**) Hickey talk 1 of N that's worth every minute (even if you don't care at all about programming).
* [An End to Negativity](http://jsconf.eu/2011/an_end_to_negativity.html) (**Chris Williams, JSConf.eu 2011**) Pure passion. 
* [Surge 2011 Key Note](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNhn-bNc96Y) (**Ben Fried, Surge 2011**) Lessons learned and practical advice related to the importance of being a technical generalist. Also, no slides; few can pull this off well. 
* [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366) (**Bret Victor, CUSEC 2012**) Driven thinker and technologist talking about important things. 
* [WAT](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) (**Gary Bernardt, CodeMash 2012**) Hilarious and entertaining. Arguably a perfect lightning talk. 
* [Instant-ish Real Service Architecture](https://vimeo.com/37930578) (**Ted Nyman, BashoChats**) Smart, witty, and immediately applicable. Also gives you a simple call to action (which many speakers forget to do).
* [How Eventual is Eventual Consistency?](https://vimeo.com/37758648) (**Peter Bailis, Basho Chats**)  Great example of how to take an abstract concept and turn it into a practical talk with concrete findings and advice. Peter's also a high-caliber speaker.
* [Metrics, Metrics Everywhere](http://pivotallabs.com/talks/139-metrics-metrics-everywhere) (**Coda Hale, Pivotal Labs Tech Talks**) Make better decisions by using numbers. (contributed by [@michaelfairley](https://twitter.com/#!/michaelfairley))
* [Persistent Data Structures and Managed References](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey) (**Rich Hickey**) Describes Clojure's approach to state, identity and concurrency. (contributed by [@michaelklishin](https://twitter.com/#!/michaelklishin))
* [The DCI Architecture: Lean and Agile at the Code Level](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/The-DCI-Architecture) (**Jim Coplien**) Thought provoking insight into how modern "class oriented" programming is different from intents behind origins of OOP. (contributed by [Serge Balyuk](https://github.com/bgipsy))
* [Machine Learning: A Love Story](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Machine-Learning) (**Hilary Mason**) A history of Machine Learning, covering major milestones over the last two decades. (contributed by [@vedang](http://twitter.com/vedang))
